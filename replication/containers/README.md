# Containers

Containers are available for each system.

For each container, the .ipynb file generates the scripts launching the different configurations of the software system under test.

Due to the size of the files, we did not include the inputs in containers, and removed the "scripts", "logs", "output" and "inputs" directories, so please contact us if you want to be able to build them and modify the containers. 

All containers are available in dockerhub, see the README file of the replication directory for more details.
