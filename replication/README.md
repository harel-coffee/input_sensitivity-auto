## Replication

The directory "measurements" details how to replicate the measurements (or reproduce with other videos).

The directory "code" details how to run the code.

The directory "information" details the configuration of the environment used to measure x264 performances. **You don't need it to replicate the measurements or the code**, but it can be useful to have information about the environment, and experiment protocol context.
