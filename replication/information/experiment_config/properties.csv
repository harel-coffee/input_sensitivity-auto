Banding Mean Opinion Score,"Banding is a common video artifact caused by compressinglow texture regions with coarse quantization. Relatively few previous attempts exist to address banding and none incorpo-rate subjective testing for calibrating the measurement. In thispaper, we propose a novel metric that incorporates both edgelength and contrast across the edge to measure video band-ing. We further introduce both reference and non-reference metrics. Our results demonstrate that the new metrics have avery high correlation with subjective assessment and certainly outperforms Peak Signal Noise Ratio, Structural SIMilarity, and Video Quality Measurement.", A perceptual visibility metric for banding artifacts (Wang et. al.)
Self-reference based LEarning-free Evaluator of Quality Mean Opinion Score,No-Reference (NR) video quality assessment (VQA) models are gaining popularity as they offer scope for  broader applicability to user-uploaded video-centric services such as YouTube and Facebook where the pristine references are unavailable. However there are few well-performing NR-VQA models owing to the difficulty of the problem. We propose a novel NR video quality predictor that solely relies on the quality-aware natural statistical models in the space-time domain. The proposed quality predictor called Self-reference based LEarning free Evaluator of Quality (SLEEQ) consists of three components: feature extraction in the spatial and temporal domains motion-based feature fusion and spatial-temporal feature pooling to derive a single quality score for a given video. SLEEQ achieves higher than 0.9 correlation with the subjective video quality scores on tested public databases and thus outperforms the existing NR VQA models., A no-reference video quality predictor for compression and scaling artifacts (Ghadiyaram et. al.)

Spatial complexity ,In general spatial detail in a frame is correlated with the bits used to encode that frame when encoded as an Intra frame. Over a 20 sec chunk therefore we calculate our spatial complexity feature as the average I frame bitrate normalized by the frame area., YouTube UGC Dataset for Video Compression Research (Wang et. al.)
Color complexity,We define color complexity metric as the ratio between the average of mean Sum of Squared Error (SSE) in U and V channels to the mean SSE in Y channel (obtained from Peak Signal Noise Ratio measurements). A high score means complex color variations in the frame and a low score usually means a gray image with only luminance changes., YouTube UGC Dataset for Video Compression Research (Wang et. al.)
Temporal complexity,The number of bits used to encode a P frame is proportional to the temporal complexity of a sequence. However visual material with high spatial complexity (large I frames) tends to have large P frames because small motion compensation errors lead to large residuals. To decouple this effect we normalize the P frame bits by taking a ratio with the I frame bits as a fair indicator of temporal complexity.,  YouTube UGC Dataset for Video Compression Research (Wang et. al.)
Chunk complexity,"To explore quality variation within the video, we measured the standard deviation of compressed bitrates among all 1 sec chunks (also normalized by the frame size). If the scene is static or has a smooth motion the chunk variation score should be close to 0 and the row sum map has no sudden changes. Multiple scene changes within a video (common in Gaming videos) will lead to multiple different regions on the row sum map.",  YouTube UGC Dataset for Video Compression Research (Wang et. al.)
