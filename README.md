# Input Sensitivity

This is the companion repository related to our paper "Input Sensitivity on the Performance of Configurable Systems: An Empirical Study" submitted to the Journal of Software and Systems.

## Organization

Measurements and details about data can be consulted in the **data** folder.

Source code can be found in the **src** directory.

The **results** folder contains the results shown in the submission, as well as complementary results.

The **replication** folder contains all you need to replicate our experiments.

The article (pdf file) can be consulted directly in the root directory.


## Our research work in a nutshell

This paper **investigates, demonstrates and quantifies how inputs of software systems interact with their configurations, thus changing their performance.**
