Sadly, the pretty print for jupyter does not work with anonymous repository... Of course, you can download it and look at the code with jupyter!

We highly recommend to consult the bitrate markdown file in the main folder: 

https://anonymous.4open.science/r/df319578-8767-47b0-919d-a8e57eb67d25/src/main/bitrate.md

The other folder contains notebooks :
- about other performances ; such performance properties are not as heavily commented as bitrate (i.e., there is no associated Markdown), but computational notebooks are available, can be re-executed, contain comprehensive results, and follow a similiar structure.

- other attempts ; for an example, we analyze 3000+ commits of x264 to find domain knwoledge about compression related to x264 performances.

See the other folder:

https://anonymous.4open.science/r/df319578-8767-47b0-919d-a8e57eb67d25/src/other/

We are available (of course after the double blind review) if you want to discuss one research direction with us.

Have a good review!
