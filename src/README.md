Sadly, the pretty print for jupyter does not work with anonymous repository...

Of course, you can download it and look at the code with jupyter!

I you don't have the time to do it, just consult the bitrate markdown file in the main folder!

The other folder contains other attempts, but they are not commented like bitrate.md, and are not mentioned in the ICSE submission.

We are available (of course after the double blind review) if you want to discuss one research direction with us.

Have a good review!
