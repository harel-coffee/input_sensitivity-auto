### What's the purpose of the notebook?

We want to ensure the robustness of the estimation of the IS Score, to be sure that our estimation will be easily retrieved by other researchers. To do so, we compute the IS score related to other research papers and compare it to our results.

### Results 

We found similar results with the ICPE 2020 research paper, on x264.
