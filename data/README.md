## Data

Three folders are available :

- old references old measurements, the replication of a study done by Pereira et al.

- ugc contains new measurements (res_ugc) for the Youtube UGC dataset, and ugc_meta, a list of meta information about videos. The res_ugc matches with the zip file in the zenodo repository : https://zenodo.org/record/3928253

- commits_x264 is associated to a study we've done on x264 commits to complement our understanding of the documentation. It leads to the commits_input_sensitivity timeline of interesting commits. We choose keywords to obtain the commits associated to the encoding sizes (and performances in general) of videos.
